       <p>Identifying the country with the most lakes is not a simple task. The ambiguity regarding the definition of a lake is one of the main reasons why the task is so difficult. According to National Geographic, a lake is simply a large body of water that is surrounded by land. National Geographic notes that small bodies of water surrounded by land should be referred to as ponds. </p> 

      <p>From this definition, no sizes have been stipulated to distinguish ponds and lakes apart which causes ambiguity. Another challenge that comes with identifying the number of lakes in a country is that many lakes are undocumented and some lack names. That being said, some countries have been studied and have been found to have more lakes than other countries. The analysis below shows the country with the most lakes.</p>

      <p>Canada has been found to have the highest number of lakes in the world. Canada's large size may be a contributing factor to the number of lakes in the country. The lakes began developing due to the intense glacial activities. Approximately 60% of the world's lakes are found in Canada.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, the Government of Canada has reported that there are 31,752 major lakes in the country. These lakes each cover an area of over 3 km squared (1.8 miles squared). The number of lakes that cover an area of over 100km squared (62 miles squared) is 561. It is also estimated that the number of small lakes is close to two million. About 9% of Canada is covered by freshwater. The largest lake that is entirely in Canada's territory is the Great Bear Lake which covers an area of approximately 31,328 km squared (19,466 miles squared).</p>
